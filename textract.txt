 Spreadsheet Details

· An Edit Identifier is used to uniquely identify each row in an Edit Spreadsheet. It consists of
the following fields separated by periods:

* TR3 Identifier.

* TR3 Page reference for the segment identified.

* TR3 Loop ID (if there is no loop ID there will be two periods together).

* Segment ID and Element Position.

* Edit Number (within the Segment ID / Element Position).
· The Accept/Reject Column will be populated with one of the following values as indicated

below:

* R - The transaction set (ST-SE) is rejected back to the submitter.
* E - The transaction set (ST-SE) is passed to the CEM where additional validation occurs. Rejections
for both syntax and business reasons will occur at the claim level within the CEM.
* T - The error is identified in the translator and an STC record is added to the 837 flat file following the
segment that had the error.
* C - The error is identified in the CEM, a 277CA flat file, including the business error information, will
be generated.

· Acronyms:

* CSC - Claim Status Code.

* CSCC - Claim Status Category Code.

* EIC - Entity Identifier Code.

· Edit inclusion methodology:

* If a segment/element/composite is required, based on either guide usage or by situational rule
interpretation, there will be an edit that indicates it must be present.
* If a segment/element/composite is not used, based on either guide usage or by situational rule
interpretation, there will be an edit that indicates that it must not be present.
* If a segment/element/composite does not have either of those explicit notations, the edits listed will
apply when the segment/element/component is present.

· Assumptions: y

w orksheet, all X12 IG instructions must be followed.

constraints or business rules. This notation indicates that the information is stored on the repository but

not used in any CMS system processing.

NUBC manual. Specific criteria will not be included in this document.

included when they can be consistently enforced by a transaction receiver. In the absence of

consistently enforceable criteria, no edit will be included to control inclusion/exclusion.

Example: 2320 COB Payer Amt Paid - there is no way for the receiver to determine whether the claim

has been adjudicated by the payer in Loop 2330B, so no edit will be included for that criteria.

* Format definitions, rules, restrictions, guidance, or instructions published by the code set owner of an

e x ternal gcode set must be met for a code from an external code set to be notegd as "valid".

qualifier clause (Only one iteration of 2300.HI with HI01-1 = "DR" is allowed), otherwise the segment

edit will just include the number of iterations allowed (Only one iteration of 2310C.NM1 is allowed).

· Valid dates - dates must be valid according to the calendar for the specific year.

* Only 01 - 12 are valid for the month positions of the date field.

* If month is "01", the day positions may be populated with 01 - 31.
* If month is "02", the day positions may be populated with 01 - 28, except during leap years (2008 was
a leap year, leap years occur every 4 years) when the day positions may be populated with 01 - 29.

* If month is "03", the day positions may be populated with 01 - 31.

* If month is "04", the day positions may be populated with 01 - 30.

* If month is "05", the day positions may be populated with 01 - 31.

* If month is "06", the day positions may be populated with 01 - 30.

* If month is "07", the day positions may be populated with 01 - 31.

* If month is "08", the day positions may be populated with 01 - 31.

* If month is "10", the day positions may be populated with 01 - 31.

* If month is "12", the day positions may be populated with 01 - 31.

· Future Date edits:
* Edits restricting a date field from being a "future date" should be evaluated against the date the file
was received.

· Numeric edits:

* Positive/Negative/Zero:
- Any numeric value with an edit that indicates it must be >= 0 means that negative numbers are
not allowed.
- Any numeric value with an edit that indicates it must be > 0 means that neither zero nor
negative numbers are allowed.
 - If neither of these explicit edit are present, negative, zero, and positive numbers are allowed.
* If an edit references a numeric value (must be >=, <= or = with a numeric limitation) implies a numeric
content requirement so the standard numeric check will not be included.

* The words "digit" or "digits" in an edit implies numeric content.
· Alphanumeric edits:

* The words "character" or "characters" in an edit implies alphanumeric content.
* If the data of an AN element or composite is from an external code list, the standard AN edits will not
be included.
· If an edit contains a bracketed clause, [clause], each contractor must supply the information
noted in the edit (e.g. receiver code).

Terms and Definitions

· The flow of the transactions is:
* Front end processing commercial translator edits, specific to each contractor.

- EDI syntax integrity validation

· Valid Segments (e.g. valid segment identifier, number of elements, delimiters)

· Segment order (as defined by the X12 / NCPDP standard)

· Element Attributes (e.g. X12 usage, repetitions, data type, and min/max size)

· Numeric element validation (e.g. leading minus signs, decimal points for R data types)

· X12 / NCPDP syntactical rules

- HIPAA syntax integrity validation based upon adopted specifications (X12 / NCPDP)

· Repeat maximums for segments, loops, elements (when repeating element are used)

· Used and un-used qualifiers, (internal) codes, elements, and segments
· Intra-segment situational data elements (e.g. DTP for auto accident becomes required when
CLM011-1 or CLM11-2 is "AA" or "OA")
* Common edit module identical processing across contractors

- External code source validation

- All CMS business rule validation that is evaluated post-translation
 - Balancing edits

- Situation based edits

- Code Set edits

- Product Type/Type of Service edits

* Shared system CMS claims processing system.

set (ST-SE) will continue to be evaluated against the translator errors before being passed to the CEM

for additional validation. When an error is identified an STC record is added to the 837 flat file following

the segment with the identified error.

 Exception: If the 999E is based on usage of a "Not Used" element only a 999E will be generated and

sent back to the submitter. No corresponding 277 will be created in the flat file for this type of error.

Assumptions

· 277 acknowledgements and 999 acknowledgements are not mutually exclusive.

Gaenseartoals Edayit eRpuo lteusp:to e p e e tat o a sact o Set Sy ta o Codes, ( 50 506),

for reporting one or many transaction set errors. The first error is reported in the first error element
(IK502). If there is a second error, it is reported in the second error element (IK503), and so on through
the fifth error element (IK506). IK502: 6 "Missing or Invalid Transaction Set Identifier" is in the
Duplicate ST-SE transaction sets shall be rejected as follows:
CSCC A8: Acknowledgement / Rejected for relational field in error
CSC 746: Duplicate Submission. Note: use only at the information receiver level in the Health Care
Claim Acknowledgement transaction
EIC: 40: Receiver

These are the priority rules. They supersede the secondary rules whenever there is a conflict
between the instructions.
 · 999R edits stand alone. They are not associated with a corresponding 277 error.

· 999E edits are always followed by a 277T edit.

* Exception: a 999E based on usage of a "Not Used" element stands alone.

· 277C edits stand alone. They are not associated with a corresponding 999 error.

· 277T edits are usually preceded by a 999E edit but can stand alone.
* Special Case: When an element has more than one error that can be identified in the translator, there
c a n be multiple 277Ts following one 999E.g
acknowledged as shown in the spreadsheet. If envelope errors result in a transaction not being
recognized as an X12 transaction, contractors have flexibility on how to acknowledge the transaction.

· All Table 1 edits result in a 999R or TA1 rejection.

* Exception: "Not Used" elements will be associated with stand-alone 999E edits.

· All Table 2 edits related to CMS business constraints will be associated with a 277 edit.
* EDI Syntax Integrity Validation (WEDI Level 1) or HIPAA Syntax Integrity Validation, which includes
Situational Rule Validation (WEDI Level 2) edits will be associated with a 277T edit.

* Common Edit Module validation (WEDI Levels 3 through 6) edits will be associated with a 277C edit.
· All Table 2 edits related to CMS technical constraints will be associated with a 999E followed by a
277T edit.
* Examples: amounts or quantities for which CMS's internal system size is smaller than the IG allowed
maximum.

 Spreadsheet Details

· An Edit Identifier is used to uniquely identify each row in an Edit Spreadsheet. It consists of the following fields separated by periods:

* TR3 Identifier.

* TR3 Page reference for the segment identified.

* TR3 Loop ID (if there is no loop ID there will be two periods together).

* Segment ID and Element Position.

* Edit Number (within the Segment ID / Element Position).
· The Accept/Reject Column will be populated with one of the following values as indicated below:

* R - The transaction set (ST-SE) is rejected back to the submitter.
* E - The transaction set (ST-SE) is passed to the CEM where additional validation occurs. Rejections for both syntax and business reasons will occur at the claim level within
the CEM.

* T - The error is identified in the translator and an STC record is added to the 837 flat file following the segment that had the error.

* C - The error is identified in the CEM, a 277CA flat file, including the business error information, will be generated.
· Acronyms:

* CSC - Claim Status Code.

* CSCC - Claim Status Category Code.

* EIC - Entity Identifier Code.
· Edit inclusion methodology:

* If a segment/element/composite is required, based on either guide usage or by situational rule interpretation, there will be an edit that indicates it must be present.

* If a segment/element/composite is not used, based on either guide usage or by situational rule interpretation, there will be an edit that indicates that it must not be present.

* If a segment/element/composite does not have either of those explicit notations, the edits listed will apply when the segment/element/component is present.
· Assumptions:
* The edits included in the spreadsheet are intended to clarify the X12N Implementation Guide instructions or add Medicare specific requirements. Unless otherwise explicitly
specified in the EDITS worksheet, all X12 IG instructions must be followed.
* Segments noted as "Pass through, syntax only" will not include CMS specific edits based on system constraints or business rules. This notation indicates that the information
is stored on the repository but not used in any CMS system processing.

* Front End processing will determine billing criteria (inpatient, outpatient, POA, etc.) based on the NUBC manual. Specific criteria will not be included in this document.
* Conditional statements regarding inclusion or exclusion of segment/element/composites will be included when they can be consistently enforced by a transaction receiver. In
the absence of consistently enforceable criteria, no edit will be included to control inclusion/exclusion.
Example: 2320 COB Payer Amt Paid - there is no way for the receiver to determine whether the claim has been adjudicated by the payer in Loop 2330B, so no edit will be
included for that criteria.
* Format definitions, rules, restrictions, guidance, or instructions published by the code set owner of an external code set must be met for a code from an external code set to
be noted as "valid".
* If a segment is repeated at the same location with different qualifiers, the segment edit will include a qualifier clause (Only one iteration of 2300.HI with HI01-1 = "DR" is
allowed), otherwise the segment edit will just include the number of iterations allowed (Only one iteration of 2310C.NM1 is allowed).
· Valid dates - dates must be valid according to the calendar for the specific year.

* Only 01 - 12 are valid for the month positions of the date field.

* If month is "01", the day positions may be populated with 01 - 31.
* If month is "02", the day positions may be populated with 01 - 28, except during leap years (2008 was a leap year, leap years occur every 4 years) when the day positions
may be populated with 01 - 29.

* If month is "03", the day positions may be populated with 01 - 31.

* If month is "04", the day positions may be populated with 01 - 30.

* If month is "05", the day positions may be populated with 01 - 31.

* If month is "06", the day positions may be populated with 01 - 30.

* If month is "07", the day positions may be populated with 01 - 31.

* If month is "08", the day positions may be populated with 01 - 31.

* If month is "09", the day positions may be populated with 01 - 30.

* If month is "10", the day positions may be populated with 01 - 31.

* If month is "11", the day positions may be populated with 01 - 30.

* If month is "12", the day positions may be populated with 01 - 31.
· Future Date edits:

* Edits restricting a date field from being a "future date" should be evaluated against the date the file was received.
· Numeric edits:

* Positive/Negative/Zero:
- Any numeric value with an edit that indicates it must be >= 0 means that negative numbers are not allowed.

- Any numeric value with an edit that indicates it must be > 0 means that neither zero nor negative numbers are allowed.

- If neither of these explicit edit are present, negative, zero, and positive numbers are allowed.
 * If an edit references a numeric value (must be >=, <= or = with a numeric limitation) implies a numeric content requirement so the standard numeric check will not be
included.
* The words "digit" or "digits" in an edit implies numeric content.
· Alphanumeric edits:

* The words "character" or "characters" in an edit implies alphanumeric content.
* If the data of an AN element or composite is from an external code list, the standard AN edits will not be included.
· If an edit contains a bracketed clause, [clause], each contractor must supply the information noted in the edit (e.g. receiver code).

Terms and Definitions

· The flow of the transactions is:
* Front end processing commercial translator edits, specific to each contractor.

- EDI syntax integrity validation
· Valid Segments (e.g. valid segment identifier, number of elements, delimiters)
· Segment order (as defined by the X12 / NCPDP standard)
· Element Attributes (e.g. X12 usage, repetitions, data type, and min/max size)
· Numeric element validation (e.g. leading minus signs, decimal points for R data types)
· X12 / NCPDP syntactical rules
- HIPAA syntax integrity validation based upon adopted specifications (X12 / NCPDP)
· Repeat maximums for segments, loops, elements (when repeating element are used)
· Used and un-used qualifiers, (internal) codes, elements, and segments
· Intra-segment situational data elements (e.g. DTP for auto accident becomes required when CLM011-1 or CLM11-2 is "AA" or "OA")
* Common edit module identical processing across contractors

- External code source validation
- All CMS business rule validation that is evaluated post-translation
- Balancing edits
- Situation based edits
- Code Set edits
- Product Type/Type of Service edits
* Shared system CMS claims processing system.
· 277 Denotes that a 277 acknowledgement will be returned to the submitter.
* 277T This designation is used when an error is identified in front end processing (before the common edit module is invoked). When this type of error is identified an STC
record is added to the 837 flat file following the segment with the identified error.
* 277C This designation is used when an error is identified in the common edit module. When this type of error is identified an STC record is added to the 277 flat file
following the segment with the identified error.
· 999 Denotes that a 999 acknowledgement will be returned to the submitter.
* 999R This designation is used when an identified error causes the transaction set (ST-SE) to be rejected back to the submitter. If multiple transaction sets are included in
one functional group, only the transaction set with an identified 999R error will be rejected, not all the transaction sets in the functional group.
* 999E This designation is used when processing continues after an error is identified; the transaction set (ST-SE) will continue to be evaluated against the translator errors
before being passed to the CEM for additional validation. When an error is identified an STC record is added to the 837 flat file following the segment with the identified error.
 Exception: If the 999E is based on usage of a "Not Used" element only a 999E will be generated and sent back to the submitter. No corresponding 277 will be created in the
flat file for this type of error.

Assumptions

· 277 acknowledgements and 999 acknowledgements are not mutually exclusive.

General Edit Rules:

Duplicate ST-SE transaction sets shall be rejected as follows:
CSCC A8: Acknowledgement / Rejected for relational field in error
CSC 746: Duplicate Submission. Note: use only at the information receiver level in the Health Care Claim Acknowledgement transaction
EIC: 40: Receiver
These are the priority rules. They supersede the secondary rules whenever there is a conflict between the instructions.

· 999R edits stand alone. They are not associated with a corresponding 277 error.
 · 999E edits are always followed by a 277T edit.
* Exception: a 999E based on usage of a "Not Used" element stands alone.
· 277C edits stand alone. They are not associated with a corresponding 999 error.
· 277T edits are usually preceded by a 999E edit but can stand alone.
* Special Case: When an element has more than one error that can be identified in the translator, there can be multiple 277Ts following one 999E.
· Envelope edits - if a transaction is recognized as an X12 transaction with envelope errors, it must be acknowledged as shown in the spreadsheet. If envelope errors result
in a transaction not being recognized as an X12 transaction, contractors have flexibility on how to acknowledge the transaction.
· All Table 1 edits result in a 999R or TA1 rejection.
* Exception: "Not Used" elements will be associated with stand-alone 999E edits.
· All Table 2 edits related to CMS business constraints will be associated with a 277 edit.
* EDI Syntax Integrity Validation (WEDI Level 1) or HIPAA Syntax Integrity Validation, which includes Situational Rule Validation (WEDI Level 2) edits will be associated with a
277T edit.
* Common Edit Module validation (WEDI Levels 3 through 6) edits will be associated with a 277C edit.
· All Table 2 edits related to CMS technical constraints will be associated with a 999E followed by a 277T edit.
* Examples: amounts or quantities for which CMS's internal system size is smaller than the IG allowed maximum.

Translators may report up to five Implementation Transaction Set Syntax Error Codes, (IK502-IK506), for reporting one or many transaction set errors. The first
error is reported in the first error element (IK502). If there is a second error, it is reported in the second error element (IK503), and so on through the fifth error
element (IK506). IK502: 6 "Missing or Invalid Transaction Set Identifier" is in the spreadsheet as an example.

These are the secondary rules. They apply only when they do not violate the priority rules.

· Loops that are not accepted based on Medicare business rules will be associated with a stand-alone 277T edit.
 · Segments that are not accepted based on Medicare business rules will be associated with a stand-alone 277T edit.
· All … must be populated with accepted AN characters edits will be associated with a 999R (IK403=6).
· All …must be # - ## characters edits will be associated with a 999E (IK403=4 or IK403=5)/277T edit combination.
· All …must be {<, >, =, <=,>=} edits that establish element length will be associated with a 999E (IK403=4 or IK403=5)/277T edit combination.
· All …must contain at least ## non-space characters edits will be associated with a 999R edit (IK403=6).
· All …must be present edits at the segment level will be associated with a 999R edit (IK304=3).
Exception: if the edit reflects Medicare business rules instead of X12 syntax rules, the edit will be associated with a 277T edit.
· All …must be present edits at the element level will be associated with a 999R edit (IK403=1).
Exception: if the edit reflects Medicare business rules instead of X12 syntax rules, the edit will be associated with a 277T edit.
· All If … is not present, … must be present edits at the segment level will be associated with a 999R edit (IK304=I6).
· All If … is present, … must be present edits referring to a relationship between two elements within the same segment will be associated with a 999R edit (IK403=2).
· All If … is present, … must be present edits referring to a relationship between two different segments will be associated with a 277C edit.
· All If …is present, ….may be present edits referring to a relationship between two elements within the same segment will be associated with a 999R edit (IK403=10).
· All If … is present, … may be present edits referring to a relationship between two different segments will be associated with a 999R edit (IK304=I9).
· All …must be valid values edits will be associated with a 999R edit (IK403=7).
· All …must be {explicit value} edits will be associated with a 999R edit (IK403=7).
· All …must be numeric edits will be associated with a 999R edit (IK403=6).
· All external code source edits will be associated with a 277C edit.
· All must be an integer edits will be associated with a 999R edit (IK403=6).
· All must be a valid date edits will be associated with a 999R edit (IK403=8).
· All must be a valid time edits will be associated with a 999R edit (IK403=8).
· All must not be present edits at the segment level will be associated with a 277T edit.
· All must not be present edits at the element level will be associated with a 999E edit (IK403=I10).
· All If ...NM102 is 2 , … must not be present edits will be associated with a 999R edit (IK403=I13).
· All dollar amounts or numeric elements that use <, >, =, <=, or >= to establish value limits will be associated with a 277T edit.
· All edits limiting the number of iterations of a segment will be associated with a 999R (IK304=5).
* Exception: All edits limiting the number of iterations of the first segment of a loop will be associated with a 999R (IK304=4).

Segment or Element Specific Edit Rules:
These are the tertiary rules. They apply only when they do not violate the priority or secondary rules.
· In Loops 1000A and 2010AA, NM109 edits referring to approved electronic submitter (trading partner management edits) will be associated with a 999R edit (trading
partner management edits).
· Elements that are situational in the TR3 but listed as "must not be present" and shaded gray on the edits spreadsheets are not to be mapped to the flat file.

 added the following General Edit Rule to the Edit 8/25/2014 Request from FCSO's translator vendor
 Rules Tab:
 General Edit Rules:
 Translators may report up to five Implementation
 Transaction Set Syntax Error Codes, (IK502-
 IK506), for reporting one or many transaction set
 errors. The first error is reported in the first error
 element (IK502). If there is a second error, it is
 reported in the second error element (IK503), and
 so on through the fifth error element (IK506).
 IK502: 6 "Missing or Invalid Transaction Set
 Identifier" is in the spreadsheet as an example.

 Spreadsheet Details

· An Edit Identifier is used to uniquely identify each row in an Edit Spreadsheet. It consists of
the following fields separated by periods:

* TR3 Identifier.

* TR3 Page reference for the segment identified.

* TR3 Loop ID (if there is no loop ID there will be two periods together).

* Segment ID and Element Position.

* Edit Number (within the Segment ID / Element Position).
· The Accept/Reject Column will be populated with one of the following values as indicated

below:

* R - The transaction set (ST-SE) is rejected back to the submitter.
* E - The transaction set (ST-SE) is passed to the CEM where additional validation occurs. Rejections
for both syntax and business reasons will occur at the claim level within the CEM.
* T - The error is identified in the translator and an STC record is added to the 837 flat file following the
segment that had the error.
* C - The error is identified in the CEM, a 277CA flat file, including the business error information, will
be generated.

· Acronyms:

* CSC - Claim Status Code.

* CSCC - Claim Status Category Code.

* EIC - Entity Identifier Code.

· Edit inclusion methodology:

* If a segment/element/composite is required, based on either guide usage or by situational rule
interpretation, there will be an edit that indicates it must be present.
* If a segment/element/composite is not used, based on either guide usage or by situational rule
interpretation, there will be an edit that indicates that it must not be present.
* If a segment/element/composite does not have either of those explicit notations, the edits listed will
apply when the segment/element/component is present.

· Assumptions: y

w orksheet, all X12 IG instructions must be followed.

constraints or business rules. This notation indicates that the information is stored on the repository but

not used in any CMS system processing.

* Front End processing will determine billing criteria (inpatient, outpatient, POA, etc.) based on the

NUBC manual. Specific criteria will not be included in this document.
 g g g

included when they can be consistently enforced by a transaction receiver. In the absence of

consistently enforceable criteria, no edit will be included to control inclusion/exclusion.

Example: 2320 COB Payer Amt Paid - there is no way for the receiver to determine whether the claim

has been adjudicated by the payer in Loop 2330B, so no edit will be included for that criteria.

* Format definitions, rules, restrictions, guidance, or instructions published by the code set owner of an

e x ternal gcode set must be met for a code from an external code set to be notegd as "valid".

qualifier clause (Only one iteration of 2300.HI with HI01-1 = "DR" is allowed), otherwise the segment

edit will just include the number of iterations allowed (Only one iteration of 2310C.NM1 is allowed).

· Valid dates - dates must be valid according to the calendar for the specific year.

* Only 01 - 12 are valid for the month positions of the date field.

* If month is "01", the day positions may be populated with 01 - 31.
* If month is "02", the day positions may be populated with 01 - 28, except during leap years (2008 was
a leap year, leap years occur every 4 years) when the day positions may be populated with 01 - 29.

* If month is "03", the day positions may be populated with 01 - 31.

* If month is "04", the day positions may be populated with 01 - 30.

* If month is "05", the day positions may be populated with 01 - 31.

* If month is "06", the day positions may be populated with 01 - 30.

* If month is "07", the day positions may be populated with 01 - 31.

* If month is "08", the day positions may be populated with 01 - 31.

* If month is "09", the day positions may be populated with 01 - 30.

* If month is "10", the day positions may be populated with 01 - 31.

* If month is "11", the day positions may be populated with 01 - 30.

* If month is "12", the day positions may be populated with 01 - 31.

· Future Date edits:
* Edits restricting a date field from being a "future date" should be evaluated against the date the file
was received.

· ICD Codes:

* Edits that are specific to the period when ICD-9 is allowed are highlighted in pink.

* Edits that are specific to the period when ICD-10 is allowed are highlighted in turquoise.
· Numeric edits:
 * Positive/Negative/Zero:
- Any numeric value with an edit that indicates it must be >= 0 means that negative numbers are
not allowed.
- Any numeric value with an edit that indicates it must be > 0 means that neither zero nor
negative numbers are allowed.

- If neither of these explicit edit are present, negative, zero, and positive numbers are allowed.
* If an edit references a numeric value (must be >=, <= or = with a numeric limitation) implies a numeric
content requirement so the standard numeric check will not be included.

* The words "digit" or "digits" in an edit implies numeric content.

· Alphanumeric edits:

* The words "character" or "characters" in an edit implies alphanumeric content.
* If the data of an AN element or composite is from an external code list, the standard AN edits will not
be included.
· If an edit contains a bracketed clause, [clause], each contractor must supply the information
noted in the edit (e.g. receiver code).

Terms and Definitions

· The flow of the transactions is:

* Front end processing commercial translator edits, specific to each contractor.

- EDI syntax integrity validation

· Valid Segments (e.g. valid segment identifier, number of elements, delimiters)

· Segment order (as defined by the X12 / NCPDP standard)

· Element Attributes (e.g. X12 usage, repetitions, data type, and min/max size)

· Numeric element validation (e.g. leading minus signs, decimal points for R data types)

· X12 / NCPDP syntactical rules

- HIPAA syntax integrity validation based upon adopted specifications (X12 / NCPDP)

· Repeat maximums for segments, loops, elements (when repeating element are used)

· Used and un-used qualifiers, (internal) codes, elements, and segments
· Intra-segment situational data elements (e.g. DTP for auto accident becomes required when
CLM011-1 or CLM11-2 is "AA" or "OA")
 * Common edit module identical processing across contractors

- External code source validation

- All CMS business rule validation that is evaluated post-translation

- Balancing edits

- Situation based edits

- Code Set edits

- Product Type/Type of Service edits
* Shared system CMS claims processing system.

set (ST-SE) will continue to be evaluated against the translator errors before being passed to the CEM

for additional validation. When an error is identified an STC record is added to the 837 flat file following

the segment with the identified error.

 Exception: If the 999E is based on usage of a "Not Used" element only a 999E will be generated and

sent back to the submitter. No corresponding 277 will be created in the flat file for this type of error.

Assumptions

· 277 acknowledgements and 999 acknowledgements are not mutually exclusive.

General Edyit Rules: y ()

for reporting one or many transaction set errors. The first error is reported in the first error element

(IK502). If there is a second error, it is reported in the second error element (IK503), and so on through

the fifth error element (IK506). IK502: 6 "Missing or Invalid Transaction Set Identifier" is in the
 Duplicate ST-SE transaction sets shall be rejected as follows:
CSCC A8: Acknowledgement / Rejected for relational field in error
CSC 746: Duplicate Submission. Note: use only at the information receiver level in the Health Care
Claim Acknowledgement transaction
EIC: 40: Receiver

These are the priority rules. They supersede the secondary rules whenever there is a conflict
between the instructions.

· 999R edits stand alone. They are not associated with a corresponding 277 error.

· 999E edits are always followed by a 277T edit.

* Exception: a 999E based on usage of a "Not Used" element stands alone.

· 277C edits stand alone. They are not associated with a corresponding 999 error.

· 277T edits are usually preceded by a 999E edit but can stand alone.
* Special Case: When an element has more than one error that can be identified in the translator, there
c a n be multiple 277Ts following one 999E.g
acknowledged as shown in the spreadsheet. If envelope errors result in a transaction not being
recognized as an X12 transaction, contractors have flexibility on how to acknowledge the transaction.

· All Table 1 edits result in a 999R or TA1 rejection.

* Exception: "Not Used" elements will be associated with stand-alone 999E edits.

· All Table 2 edits related to CMS business constraints will be associated with a 277 edit.
* EDI Syntax Integrity Validation (WEDI Level 1) or HIPAA Syntax Integrity Validation, which includes
Situational Rule Validation (WEDI Level 2) edits will be associated with a 277T edit.

* Common Edit Module validation (WEDI Levels 3 through 6) edits will be associated with a 277C edit.
· All Table 2 edits related to CMS technical constraints will be associated with a 999E followed by a
277T edit.
* Examples: amounts or quantities for which CMS's internal system size is smaller than the IG allowed
maximum.
